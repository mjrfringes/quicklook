[Ramp]
# First read to use in ramp (first overall read is 1)
read_0 : 1
# Last read to use, None = use all reads from read_0 onwards
read_f : None
# Detector gain, used to compute photon noise
gain : 2
# Save the ramp and inverse variance as its own file?
saveramp : True

[Calib]
# Location of original calibration files
calibdir : /home/mrclean/quicklook/code/calibrations/
# Folder where the new calibration sets are kept
# for each new monochromatic flat, a folder will be created within this folder
outdir : /home/mrclean/calibdir/
# Folder where the new cubes will exist
outdircube : /home/mrclean/quicklook_reduced/
# Mask bad pixels using a mask in calibdir?
mask : True
# Apply flatfields to correct pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations
# and lenslet-to-lenslet illumination variations?
flatfield : True

[Extract]
# Spectral resolution for extraction. 
# Recommended: 30 for lowres, 100 for highres.
# PSFlet template files for this resolution must already be in calibdir.
R_lowres : 30
R_hires : 100
# Method of extraction, lstsq strongly preferred.  Other choice is optext
smoothandmask : True
# Maximum threads for parallelization.  
# Negative: leave that many threads free.  None: use number of cpus.

# Save the inverse variance?
saveivar : False
# Align cube to WCS?
alignWCS : False
# Plot annulus?
plotAnnulus : True
